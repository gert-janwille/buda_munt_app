## Getting Started

### Running the app on device

Make sure you have Node v6 or later installed. Xcode or Android Studio installation is required.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gert-janwille/buda_munt_app.git
$ cd buda_munt_app/
$ yarn run start
```

Open the Xcode project located in the ios folder. Connect your device to your machine and build & run the app using cmd+R or the build & run button on top.


### Running the app in simulator

Make sure you have Node v6 or later installed. Xcode or Android Studio installation is required.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/gert-janwille/buda_munt_app.git
$ cd buda_munt_app/
$ yarn run ios
```

If you're familiar with React Native already, you won't find any `ios` or `android` directories in this project, just JavaScript. Once this installation is done, there are some commands you can run in the project directory:

#### `npm start`

Runs your app in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the `--no-interactive` flag.

#### `npm test`

Runs the [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) test runner on your tests.

#### `npm run ios`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### `npm run ipad`

Like `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator iPad if you're on a Mac and have it installed.
